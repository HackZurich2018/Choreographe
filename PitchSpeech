The words for the demo..


We built a software for school children to identify their true skills and interests, free from bias
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To identify their skills we use the multicheck model which includes logical puzzles and questions. In real life the child would answer the questions, this is just for a simplified demo.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We identify now the interests of the kid by triggering emotions through pictures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe that many children cant live up to their potential because of the influence of the society. Usually girls play with dolls, boys play with cars - they might never experience the full range of possibilities
